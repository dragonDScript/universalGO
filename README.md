## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS, YOU SHOULDN'T USE THIS

Universal GO is a tool to package Go applications for all platforms.

Try it by downloading ugo from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dragonDScript/universalGO/releases) and placing it in a familiar location. Then Check the below guide for opening .ugo files with ugo. Docs are WIP.

## How to run .ugo files directly

Download the repo and compile universal GO for your platform. Put it in a familiar place. Then open a .ugo file and click `Properties` on Windows:
